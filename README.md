To predict values run "python3 inference.py" in the same directory and follow the text prompts.

You can view all of the predictions at once in "model_training.ipynb", although the plot isn't all that granular.

Data Pipeline:

EarthCam_DataScience_Data.csv ->  data_cleaning.ipynb -> cleaned_weather_data_1.csv -> data_analysis.ipynb -> model_data.csv -> model_training.ipynb -> forecast2024.csv -> inference_script.py
